Infrastructure is something that keeps on changing
Â 
### Use Cases:
The infrastructure cost has spiked suddenly. The CFO wants to see on what exactly has been changed since past 3 weeks

You are DevOps at XYZ organization. Last Night everything was working fine. However suddenly users report that they are not able to access the website

## AWS Config part 2
Infrastructure = Security
* Just infrastructure Monitoring is not enough
* We need to monitor Security aspect as well

Example Use case:
* All S3 buckets should have Versioning enabled
* ROOT MFA should be enabled 
* Security Group should not have 0.0.0.0/0 on Port 22
* CloudTrail must be enabled
* No unusedEIP should be present
* Based on the use case, AWS Config can show Compliance status
