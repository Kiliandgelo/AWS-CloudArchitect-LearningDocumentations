## Four Types
There are four major types of auto scaling plans which we can choose from:
* Maintain Current Instance levels
* Manual Scaling
* Scheduled Scaling
* Dynamic Scaling
Â 
## Type 1 - Maintain Current Instance Levels
We can specify in ASG to maintain a specified amount of instance running at all time
* We manually specify the minimum , maximum and ASG will manage the lifecycle of creating or terminating instance to maintain the capacity defined

## Type 2 - Manual Scaling
This is considered as the most basic way of scaling
* We manually specify the minimum, maximum and ASG will manage the lifecycle of creating or terminating instance to maintain the capacity defined
Â 
## Type 3 - Scheduled Scaling
* Certain times, we might know exactly when we will need to increase or decrease the number of instances, maybe because of predictable schedule
* Example: End of Month promotion campaign
* In scheduled scaling, scaling actions are performed automatically at user defined data & time

## Type 4 - Dynamic Scaling
Dynamic Scaling controls auto scaling process depending on policy defined by the user


### Example: 
If CPU >= 70% , add 2 instances
