Nat Gateway supports burst of up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth


Thus all the instances within the private subnet needs to have traffic less than that of 10Gbps. If more than, network will be the bottleneck


Thus when we need more bandwidth than the recommended design is to split the instance across multiple subnets and attach different NAT gateway to each of those subnets


Normal NAT Gateway based Architecture


Multiple NAT Gateway Approach
