### Getting the basics right
AWS Athena is service that allows us to analyze various log files from S3 using standard SQL

### Let's understand it with an example:
We have CloudTrail logs in AWS S3 and you want to see who has logged in, in the past 3 days
Â 
* Create EC2 instances
* Deploy monitoring stack like Splunk, ELK or others
* Add the data source from S3 to import CloudTrail logs
* Being Analyzing

### Real World Use-Case
An organization received a huge spike in traffic due to which the systems went down

We were entitled to investigate if it was genuine traffic or an attack

We used Athena to query VPC Flow Logs for certain information:
* Number of Accept and Reject Logs one hour before the spike
* Number of Accept and Reject Logs one hour after the spike
* Most number of IP address with the reject logs
* Which ENI received highest spike?
