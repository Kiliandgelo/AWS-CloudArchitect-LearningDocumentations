Auto-Scaling LifeCycle hooks allows us to have control over instance launch and termination state within auto-scaling group

### Sample Use case:
* You have EC2 instance which is scheduled to be terminated
* You want to backup all itâ€™s logs to S3 and run some de-registration scripts
* Terminate instance once 2nd steps is completed

      Step1: Instance Awaiting Termination
      Step2: Confirmation from Automation
      Step3: Go ahead
