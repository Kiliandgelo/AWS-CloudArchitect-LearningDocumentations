### Decision Making Process
* Decision starts with assumption that the request will be denied
* Then, all the attached policies are evaluated
* Code will look if there is any explicit deny in the policy
* If explicit deny is not found, code will look for allowed instruction and if yes then decision is allowed 
* If no allow is found, decision = deny

### Scenario
4 AWS S3 buckets are available


We want to give access to all the buckets in our S3, except 1 

### Step1
* Allow access to all the buckets in S3
### Step2
* Deny access to bucket 04
