## Instance Size Flexibility
* Reserved Instance provides us the flexibility to change instance size
* If we have paid ALL Upfront, does that mean we can change our current t2.medium RI to t2.large without paying anything ?

## Scenario
Letâ€™s assume we have RI for c4.8xlarge instance type 
8xlarge = 64 normalization factor


Thus we can launch either:
* 1 instance of c4.8xlarge 
* 2 instance of c4.4xlarge 
* 4 instance of c4.2xlarge 
* 16 instance of c4.large 


We can also combine like, one c4.xlarge and eight c4.large instance
