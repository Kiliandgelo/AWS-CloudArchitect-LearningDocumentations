## Standard Reserved Instance
* Standard RI provides most significant discount (up to 75%) of on-demand and are more suited for steady-state usage needs

## Convertible RI
* These provide discount (up to 54%) of on-demand and provides flexibility to change attribute of reserved instance

## Scheduled RI
* Suitable for recurring schedule and provides ability to launch within time window
Â 
## RI Types
With convertible RI, we can:
* Convert to new instance family eg R3 to M4 to C4 to T2
* Convert to new operating system eg Windows to Linux
* Convert to new instance price [eg if AWS reduces the public rate for our instance]
* Convert to new instance size [eg from m4.large to m4.2xlarge]
* Convert tenancy [eg dedicated instance to default]
* Convert to different payment option [no upfront to partial upfront]

## Capacity Reservation
We have head that Reserved Instance provide capacity reservation, but that will only apply to zonal RI and not regional RI

Customer has following instances running:
* 2 x m4.large instance running in us-east-1a and us-east-1b region
* 2 x t2.large instance running across us-east-1b and us-east-1c region

Customer has following RI:
* 1 x m4.large, default tenancy, us-east-1b region (zonal RI)
* 2 x t2.large, default tenancy, us-east-1 regional RI

Additional pay: 1x m4.large instance will be charged at the on-demand rate
