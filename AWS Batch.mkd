### Getting Started
A batch job is a collection, or list, of commands that are processed in sequence often without requiring user input or intervention

Generally batch jobs accumulate during working hours, and are then executed during the evening or another time the computer is idle

Batch jobs wait in a job queue for processing when the system has the available resources
