DynamoDB Autoscaling allows us to dynamically scale up and scale down the throughput 
Basically, there are 2 ways to define the throughput (read/write capacity units)
* On-Demand
* Provisioned

With On-Demand approach, there is no upper limit
If application receives huge surge, DynamoDB will scale and serve
However, you will also have to pay for however high it had scaled
