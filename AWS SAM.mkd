## Overview of SAM (Serverless Application Model)
We can make use of SAM to define serverless application in simple and clear syntax


### How things works ?
There are 2 important steps during the SAM process:
* Create a SAM template (JSON/YAML) that define Lambda, API and others
* Test, Upload and Deploy application using SAM CLI

### Info:
During deployment, SAM automatically translates application specs into CloudFormation Syntax
