## Elastic Beanstalk supports several options for deployments
* All at Once
* Rolling
* Rolling with Additional Batch
* Immutable

## All at Once
* Deploys new version to all the instances simultaneously
* All of he instances are out of service while deployment is in process
* If updates fails then you will need to roll back changes by re-deploying the previous working version

## Rolling Deployment Policy
* Deploys the newer version in batches
* Each batch of instances is taken out of service while deployment is taking place
* The overall capacity (in terms of servers) will be reduces while the deployment is happening
* Not recommended for performance critical applications
Â 
## Rolling with Additional Batch
* Launches additional batch of instances
* This maintains full capacity during deployments

## Immutable Deployment Policy
* Deploys newer version of the application in a completely new servers under new auto-scaling group
* When new instances passes their health-check, they are moved to older auto-scaling group and older ones are terminated
* Impact of failed update is less as all we need to do is delete the new auto-scaling group and EC2
* Preferred option for mission critical production systems
