Earlier for EC2 instances to be able to access public resources like S3, the traffic needed to be pass via Internet Gateway or even via NAT


Simplifying this approach, AWS introduced a feature called as “VPC Endpoints” are secure and highly reliable connection which provides secure connection to services like S3


Thus EC2 instance within private VPC can now connect to such services without any need of NAT gateway or even Private Gateways
