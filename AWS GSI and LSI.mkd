## Global Secondary Index
With GSI, you can query data based on any attribute within a table
 
 
Partition and Sort Keys can be different from the table

## Local Secondary Index
A local secondary index maintains an alternate sort key for a given partition key value

## Important Pointers
When you create a global secondary index on a provisioned mode table, you must specify read and write capacity units for the expected workload on that index 
 
 
The provisioned throughput settings of a global secondary index are separate from those of its base table
 
 
A query operation on a global secondary index consumes read capacity units from the index, not the base table
